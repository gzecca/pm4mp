# pm4mp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The aim of the `pm4mp` package is to support and accelerate the phylogenetic-based
identification and prioritisation of species with high medicinal potential. 
The new methods implemented in the package propose features to extend and improve 
the use of the "hot nodes" approach in bioprospecting. New functionalities have been 
introduced that allow new potentially medicinal species to be prioritised by 
assigning each a score based on its medicinal potential.
These novel methodologies are presented and discussed in Zecca et al. (2025).
 
The functions included allow to:

- download lists of medicinal plants from [CMAUP v1.0 & v2.0](https://bidd.group/CMAUP/)
  public database (Xian et al. 2019; Dongyue et al. 2024);
- check and match taxa names against a reference phylogeny provided by the user;
- prepare input files for subsequent analyses;
- call an external executable of the software [Phylocom](https://github.com/phylocom/phylocom)
  (Webb et al.2008) to perform multiple replicates of the 'nodsigl' analysis;
- import, process and summarise the outputs obtained from multiple replicates of
  the 'nodsigl' analysis according to predefined criteria and identify the 
  'hot trees' for the studied disease;
- compute the Hot Ancestry Score for all species present in the identified 
  'hot trees';
- compute the (relative) probability of being a medicinal species for all the taxa 
  present in the provided (hot) tree(s) (i.e., for all 'hot species');
- show the results graphically.

**NOTE:The [Phylocom](https://github.com/phylocom/phylocom) application, which is
required to perform the ‘nodesigl’ analysis, is not included in this package and 
must be downloaded separately by the user from the author's site.**

Not all functions of the package require the presence of Phylocom to be used. In particular the following functions can be used without Phylocom being present:

- `clean_and_match()`
- `dnu_CMAUPv1()`
- `dnu_CMAUPv2()`
- `hmpp()`
- `pr2d_CMAUPv1()`
- `pr2d_CMAUPv2()`
- `sample4nodesigl()`
- `tree4nodesigl()`
- `visual_comp()`

Conversely, the following function depends directly on Phylocom being present for
it to work:

- `nodesiglR()`

Finally, the following functions, although not directly dependent on the presence of 
Phylocom, directly or indirectly use the results of its 'nodesigl' analysis:

- `nodesigle_harvesteR()`(direct use)
- `has()`(indirect use: it needs the ouput of function`nodesigle_harvesteR()`)
- `hot_tree_painteR()`(indirect use:it needs the ouput of function`nodesigle_harvesteR()`)



### Installation
You can install the last version of `pm4mp` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gzecca/pm4mp")
```

### Load & attach
You can load and attach the installed version of `pm4mp` with:

```r
library(pm4mp)

```

### Getting help
You can use the `help()` function and the `?` help operator to access the documentation
pages for `pm4mp` functions.

```r
# load and attach
library(pm4mp)

# access the documentation page of the function has()
help("has")

# access the documentation page of the function hmpp()
?hmpp
```

### About examples in the documetation pages
* Currently, to illustrate how the package works, the examples in the documentation
  pages are built from scratch, without relying on pre-existing data. This should 
  make the format of the files used and the workflow clearer.
  However, we recognise that this is not optimal for several reasons. We therefore 
  plan to provide a vignette and example datasets in the near future.

* Since nearly all of the functions in the package generate output files, all of
  the examples presented in the documentation pages write files to the user's tempdir()
  during their execution. At the end of each example, the code needed to clean up
  the user's temp folder is provided.
