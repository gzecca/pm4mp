Description: A collection of tools to support phylogenetic-based
    identification and the prioritization of species with medicinal
    potential. Included functions allow you to: download lists of
    medicinal plants from public databases, check and match taxa names
    against a reference phylogeny, call an external 'PHYLOCOM' executable
    (Webb et al. 2008) (not included in the package!) to perform multiple
    replicates of the 'nodsigl' analysis whose outputs can be imported,
    processed and summarised in R, calculate the Hot ancestry Score and
    the (relative) probability of the taxa present in a tree to be
    medicinal species, show the results graphically.
